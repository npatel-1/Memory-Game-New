### Challenges
* I struggled hidding the numbers and making them appear when clicked on. I then spoke to a friend and told me to change the colour of the number to the current background of the card, which is black.
* The other challenge was to set both unmatch cards back to black. The first card will flip but the second card will remain black. However, I recieved help from Jack and managed to solved this problem.

### Learning points
What I really need to do is start from the smallest point and build myself up.
